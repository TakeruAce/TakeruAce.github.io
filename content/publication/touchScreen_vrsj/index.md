abstract: This study investigates the effect of pseudo-haptic feedback, which is rendered based on visuo-haptic interaction with a touch screen, on a memory task during information browsing. We compared the results of the memory task under two modification conditions (ie, with C/D ratio modification and without C/D modification) and two agency conditions (ie, with self-scrolling system and with auto-scrolling system). The participants showed the best performance of memory task under self-scrolling with C/D ratio modification. These results show that pseudo-haptic feedback on touch screen affects our memory during information browsing. This content-aware system can apply to many interface with touch screens, and help users to browse contents efficiently.
